# cPanel Deployment Guide
## Can you just upload to cPanel?

### ❌ **NO - cPanel alone won't work**

**Why:**
1. **cPanel is just a file manager** - it doesn't run Python servers
2. **No Python execution** - files sit there, don't execute
3. **No backend processing** - can't run `ddsp_server.py`
4. **No dependencies** - can't install numpy, librosa, etc.

### ✅ **What WOULD work on cPanel:**

**Option 1: Static HTML Only (Limited)**
- Upload `public/index.html` to `public_html/`
- But: **Backend won't work** (no Python execution)
- Result: Frontend loads, but MIDI upload fails

**Option 2: cPanel + SSH Access (Possible)**
- Upload files via cPanel
- SSH into server: `ssh user@yourserver.com`
- Install Python 3.8+ and dependencies
- Run: `python ddsp_server.py` in background
- Requires technical knowledge and server access

**Option 3: Shared Hosting with Python Support**
- Some hosts offer Python (PythonAnywhere, Bluehost Python plans)
- Cost: $5-20/month
- Still need to configure and run server manually

## 🚀 **RECOMMENDED DEPLOYMENT METHODS**

### **Best: Railway.app** (easiest, recommended)
✅ One-click deploy from GitHub  
✅ Automatic scaling  
✅ Built-in Python support  
✅ Persistent storage for models  
✅ Environment variables  
✅ Cost: $5-10/month  

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at railway.app (free trial)
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Connect your repo
4. Add environment variables:
   - `PORT=8000`
   - `MODEL_PATH=./models`
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Done! Your app is live at `your-app.railway.app`

---

### **Alternative: Fly.io** (similar to Railway)
✅ Similar features  
✅ Global edge deployment  
✅ Docker-based  
✅ Cost: $5-10/month  

**Steps:**
1. Install Fly CLI
2. Run: `fly launch`
3. Push: `fly deploy`
4. Your app is live at `your-app.fly.dev`

---

### **Budget: Render.com** (free tier available)
✅ Free tier exists  
✅ Auto-deploy from Git  
✅ Static site + Web service  
✅ Cost: Free or $7/month  

**Setup:**
- Create Static Site for `public/` folder
- Create Web Service for `ddsp_server.py`
- Connect GitHub, deploy

---

### **Full Control: DigitalOcean Droplet + cPanel Alternative**
✅ Full server access  
✅ Install anything  
✅ Use VPS with Webmin/cPanel alternative  
✅ Cost: $5-12/month  

**Requirements:**
1. Buy VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr)
2. Install Python, Nginx, dependencies
3. Configure reverse proxy
4. Run `ddsp_server.py` as service
5. Point domain to server

---

## ⚙️ **If You MUST Use cPanel-Like Environment**

### Setup Required:
```bash
# 1. SSH into server
ssh user@yourserver.com

# 2. Create app directory
mkdir -p /home/user/ddsp
cd /home/user/ddsp

# 3. Upload files via cPanel File Manager
# Then in SSH:
cd /home/user/public_html/ddsp

# 4. Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 5. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-production.txt

# 6. Run server in background
nohup python ddsp_server.py > server.log 2>&1 &

# 7. Check if running
ps aux | grep python
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Problems with this approach:**
- Server stops when SSH session ends (need PM2 or systemd)
- Manual restart after server reboot
- No auto-scaling
- Security risks (exposed ports)
- Need reverse proxy (Nginx) configuration

## 📊 **Comparison**

| Method | Ease | Cost | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Railway.app | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $5-10/mo | **Recommended** |
| Fly.io | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | $5-10/mo | Docker users |
| Render.com | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Free-$7/mo | Startups |
| VPS + SSH | ⭐⭐ | $5-20/mo | Full control |
| cPanel only | ❌ | $5/mo | Won't work |

## 🎯 **MY RECOMMENDATION**

**Use Railway.app** - It's designed for exactly this use case.

**Why:**
- Deploys in 5 minutes
- Handles Python + dependencies
- Auto-scales
- HTTPS included
- Persistent storage
- Environment variables
- Zero configuration needed

**Files you already have:**
✅ `Procfile` - Railway knows how to start  
✅ `railway.json` - Configuration ready  
✅ `requirements-production.txt` - Dependencies  
✅ `ddsp_server.py` - Server code  
✅ `public/index.html` - Frontend  

**Just push to GitHub and deploy!**

## 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Fix IndentationError in ddsp_server.py** ← Currently blocking
2. **Push code to GitHub**
3. **Sign up at railway.app**
4. **Deploy**
5. **Test production URL**

**cPanel Answer: NO - Use Railway.app instead!**
