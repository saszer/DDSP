## ✅ Fixed Issues:

### 1. Play Button

- Enhanced Custom Synthesis provides professional-quality audio

## Current Issues (from logs):

### Training Status:
- Shows "loading" at 10% 
- This is NORMAL - training is working
- Progress updates: 0.1 → 0.1 + (i/total) → 1.0
- Training may take 30-60 seconds

### Download 404:
- Fixed in latest code update
