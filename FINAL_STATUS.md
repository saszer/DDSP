### 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS**

#### **RECOMMENDED: Railway.app**
**Best choice for this project**

**Why:**
- ✅ Designed for Python backends
- ✅ Static frontend support
- ✅ Auto-deploy from Git
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Persistent storage for models
- ✅ HTTPS included
- ✅ Scaling built-in

**Cost:** $5-10/month (free trial available)

**Setup (5 minutes):**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Sign up at railway.app
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy!

**Your app will be live at:** `your-app.railway.app`

---

### ❌ **WON'T WORK: cPanel Only**

**Why cPanel fails:**
- cPanel is just file storage
- No Python execution
- Backend server never starts
- Dependencies don't install

**Alternative:** cPanel + SSH (but complex - see CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md)

---

### 📦 **PRODUCTION FILES CREATED**

✅ **Procfile** - Tells Railway how to start  
✅ **railway.json** - Configuration  
✅ **requirements-production.txt** - Minimal dependencies (no TensorFlow)  
✅ **PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Full deployment guide  
✅ **CPANEL_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Why cPanel won't work  
✅ **FINAL_STATUS.md** - This file

### 🎯 **PRODUCTION-READY STATUS**

**Core Features:**
- ✅ MIDI → Audio synthesis
- ✅ All synthesis controls
- ✅ All audio settings
- ✅ Model upload & switching
- ✅ Professional mastering
- ✅ Audio download

**What's Missing (Optional):**
- Advanced model validation (PKL structure deep check)

### 📋 **TO DEPLOY**

1. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   python ddsp_server.py  # Terminal 1
   python -m http.server -d public 3000  # Terminal 2
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Production ready DDSP Neural Cello"
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Railway:**
   - Go to railway.app
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub"
   - Choose your repo
   - Add environment variables:
     - `PORT=8000`
     - `MODEL_PATH=./models`
     - `OUTPUT_PATH=./output`
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Your app is live!

4. **Optional - Custom Domain:**
   - In Railway → Settings → Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Update DNS
   - Done!

### 🎵 **WHAT THIS APP DOES**

**Input:** MIDI file (.mid)  
**Processing:** Neural synthesis using 1,276 trained cello samples  
**Controls:**
- Release duration (0-100%)
- Tone (standard/warm/bright/dark/vintage)
- Sample rate (44.1/48/96 kHz)
- Bit depth (16/24/32 bit)
