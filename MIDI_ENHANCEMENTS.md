# MIDI Synthesis Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the MIDI parser and synthesis engine to extract and use ALL MIDI details for more realistic sound generation.

## What's Now Extracted from MIDI

### 1. **Tempo Changes**
- Detects `set_tempo` MIDI messages
- Calculates accurate timing based on actual BPM
- Supports tempo changes within a single MIDI file
- Previously: Assumed fixed 120 BPM

### 2. **Pitch Bends**
- Extracts `pitchwheel` messages (range: -8192 to 8191)
- Maps to semitones (-2 to +2 semitones)
- Applied to note frequency during synthesis
- Previously: Ignored pitch bends

### 3. **Expression (CC 11)**
- Extracts Control Change 11 (Expression)
- Acts as volume/dynamics multiplier (0-127)
- Combined with velocity for realistic dynamics
- Previously: Only used note-on velocity

### 4. **Modulation (CC 1)**
- Extracts Control Change 1 (Modulation)
- Applied as tremolo effect (amplitude variation)
- Rate: 5 Hz, depth: up to 15% based on CC value
- Previously: Ignored

### 5. **Polyphony Support**
- Multiple simultaneous notes are correctly mixed
- Each note processed independently with its own parameters
- Supports complex chords and overlapping notes
- Previously: Notes processed sequentially (still worked but less efficient)

### 6. **Enhanced Velocity Handling**
- Uses `effective_velocity` = `velocity × expression / 127`
- Non-linear scaling for realistic dynamics: `(velocity/127)^0.7`
- Previously: Only linear velocity scaling

## Synthesis Improvements

### ADSR Envelope
- **Attack**: 20ms fade-in for natural note onset
- **Decay**: 50ms transition to sustain level
- **Sustain**: 85% volume during note hold
- **Release**: 100ms fade-out for natural note end
- Previously: Simple 10ms fade in/out

### Pitch Processing
- Base frequency lookup from trained model
- Pitch bend applied on top of matched pitch
- Accurate pitch shifting using librosa
- Previously: Only basic pitch matching

### Time Stretching
- Uses librosa's phase vocoder for natural time-stretching
- Preserves spectral characteristics
- Handles extreme durations (tiling/truncation)
- Previously: Basic resampling

### Volume/Dynamics
- Velocity × Expression for realistic dynamics
- Non-linear scaling preserves natural feel
- Modulation adds tremolo for expressiveness
- Previously: Only velocity

## Example: What a Note Now Contains

```python
{
    'frequency': 523.25,          # Final frequency (includes pitch bend)
    'base_frequency': 523.25,     # Original MIDI note frequency
    'velocity': 80,              # Note-on velocity (0-127)
    'effective_velocity': 64,    # velocity × expression / 127
    'expression': 100,           # CC 11 value (0-127)
    'modulation': 45,             # CC 1 value (0-127)
    'pitch_bend': 0.5,           # Semitones (from pitchwheel)
    'start': 1.25,               # Start time in seconds
    'duration': 0.75,            # Duration in seconds
    'midi_note': 64              # MIDI note number
}
```

## Result

The synthesis now:
- ✅ Respects tempo changes
- ✅ Applies pitch bends accurately
- ✅ Uses expression for dynamics
- ✅ Adds tremolo from modulation
- ✅ Handles polyphony correctly
- ✅ Uses realistic ADSR envelopes
- ✅ Preserves all MIDI expressiveness

**Your MIDI files will sound much more like the original performance!**
